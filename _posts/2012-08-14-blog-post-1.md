Why I will be applying Md/PhD
======

My plan is to apply to a couple MD/PhD programs in the hopes of matriculating into one. The reseach which I am interested in conducting during the PhD portion would be in immunology or infectious diseases. I hope to use my potential degree in clinical work but also leading my own research lab at a medical university.
